# Image-Classification-by-ResNet

The goal of this project is to implement the “Hello World!” program of deep learning: designing and training a network that performs image classification. The dataset we will be using is CIFAR10 which is a large set of images that are classified into 10 classes (airplane, bird, cat, etc.).
